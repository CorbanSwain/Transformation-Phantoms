# Axis Phantom Image
*To be used in comparing rotation and translation operations*

## Description
Simple phantom volume in both .tif and .mat formats. The phantom volume 
contains three arrows corresponding to the rows (1), columns (2), and 
pages (3) representative of MATLAB's indexing style. Each of the arrows
are 'annotated' with spherical beads: the row axis arrow is annotated with 
1 bead, the column axis arrow is annotated with 2 beads, and the pages axis
arrow is annotated with three beads.
